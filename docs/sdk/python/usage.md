<h2 id="typed-system_one-responses">
  Typed <code>system\_one</code> responses
</h2>

It is possible to provide a response model to `system_one` to make using the response more *type-safe*:

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, NoulAnswer, SystemOneResponse, TypeSafeClient


class BillingResponse(SystemOneResponse):
    billing: NoulAnswer


with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    result = client.system_one(
        "I was charged twice.",
        {"billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?")},
        response_model=BillingResponse,
    )
    assert 0 <= result.billing.noul <= 1
    assert result.billing == result.nouls["billing"]
    print(result.request_id)
```

<h3 id="custom-response-types">
  Custom response types
</h3>

It is also possible to define a completely new response model without inheriting from `SystemOneResponse`:

```python theme={null}
from pydantic import BaseModel

from typesafe_sdk import Noul, NoulAnswer, TypeSafeClient


class BillingAnswers(BaseModel):
    billing: NoulAnswer


class BillingResponse(BaseModel):
    answers: BillingAnswers


result = TypeSafeClient().system_one(
    "I was charged twice.",
    {"billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?")},
    response_model=BillingResponse,
)
assert 0 <= result.answers.billing.noul <= 1
```

<h2 id="choosing-a-model">
  Choosing a model
</h2>

Inspect the available models:

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient

print(TypeSafeClient().models.list())
```

Select the model when constructing a client:

```python theme={null}
client = TypeSafeClient(model="jev")
```

See the [Models resource reference](api/clients/sync.md#models-resource) for details.

<h2 id="retries">
  Retries
</h2>

Pass a custom [`RetryPolicy`](api/retries.md) as `retry` on the client or per call.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Client">
    ```python theme={null}
    from typesafe_sdk import RetryPolicy, TypeSafeClient

    client = TypeSafeClient(retry=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3, backoff_max=0.2, timeout=1.0))
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Per-call">
    ```python theme={null}
    from typesafe_sdk import RetryPolicy

    client.system_one(
        state, questions, retry=RetryPolicy(max_retries=3, backoff_max=0.2, timeout=1.0)
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<h2 id="error-handling">
  Error handling
</h2>

Handle [exceptions](api/exceptions.md) raised by the SDK:

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeAPIError

try:
    client.system_one(state, questions)
except TypeSafeAPIError as error:
    print(error.status, error.request_id)
```

<h2 id="logging">
  Logging
</h2>

The SDK logs to the `typesafe_sdk` logger. Configure it according to [standard logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) guide:

```python theme={null}
import logging

logging.getLogger("typesafe_sdk").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

Or set `TYPESAFE_LOG_LEVEL` to one of `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, or `off` before importing the SDK.

`info` logs one summary line per request; `debug` also logs request and response headers and bodies. Secret headers — authorization, API keys, cookies, and any header whose name contains `token` or `secret` — are redacted from log output. Request and response bodies are **not** redacted.

<h2 id="environment-variables">
  Environment variables
</h2>

The SDK reads and uses the following environment variables:

| Variable                 | Configures                                          | Default                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`       | API key (required)                                  | —                         |
| `TYPESAFE_BASE_URL`      | API root URL                                        | `https://api.typesafe.ai` |
| `TYPESAFE_DEFAULT_MODEL` | Default model                                       | `jev-latest`              |
| `TYPESAFE_LOG_LEVEL`     | `typesafe_sdk` logger level, applied once at import | unset                     |

See the [constants reference](api/constants.md) for SDK defaults.

<h2 id="forward-compatibility">
  Forward compatibility
</h2>

The SDK keeps working as the TypeSafe API evolves, so you can adopt new API features before an SDK release adds first-class support for them.

<h3 id="extra-request-fields">
  Extra request fields
</h3>

Send request fields this SDK version predates with [`extra_body`](api/clients/sync.md):

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    client.system_one(
        "I was charged twice.",
        {"billing": Noul(instructions="About billing?")},
        extra_body={"beam_width": 4},
    )
```

<h3 id="raw-question-dictionaries">
  Raw question dictionaries
</h3>

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import TypeSafeClient

with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    client.system_one(
        "I was charged twice.",
        {"billing": {"type": "noul", "instructions": "About billing?", "weight": 2}},
    )
```

<Tip>
  **Tip**

  Unknown fields are a forward-compatibility escape hatch. Ignore their type-checking errors and prefer upgrading the SDK instead.
</Tip>

<h3 id="unknown-answer-kinds">
  Unknown answer kinds
</h3>

The SDK logs a warning and skips unrecognized answer kinds. Use `raw_http_response` to inspect the complete API response, including those answers:

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import Noul, TypeSafeClient

result = TypeSafeClient().system_one(
    "I was charged twice.",
    {"billing": Noul(instructions="Is this about billing?")},
)
raw_answers = result.raw_http_response.json()["answers"]
```

<h3 id="unknown-response-fields">
  Unknown response fields
</h3>

Unknown extra fields on recognized responses are ignored.
